                <h3>JAWS 2019 (aug)</h3>
                <p>When paired with Firefox and Chrome a "directory" will be discovered when navigating by lists, list items, and virtual cursor.  It will be announced as a "list" with X items, making no mention of the "directory" role.</p>
                <p>IE11 does not expose <code>role=directory</code> as a list, and JAWS does not mitigate this gap.</p>

                <h3>NVDA 2019.2.1</h3>
                <p>When paired with Firefox and Chrome a "directory" will be discovered when navigating by lists, list items, and virtual cursor.  It will be announced as a "list" with X items, making no mention of the "directory" role.</p>
                <p>IE11 does not expose <code>role=directory</code> as a list. For this pattern in particular, NVDA will ignore the role and instead respect the <code>ul</code>'s mapping to expose this pattern as a list.</p>

                <h3>iOS 12.4.1 VoiceOver</h3>
                <p>The "directory" can be discovered if using the rotor to navigate by lists. When entering, VO will announce "list start" or "list end" depending on the entry point.</p>

                <h3>macOS 10.14.5 VoiceOver with Safari 12.1.1 and Chrome</h3>
                <p>The "directory" can be discovered if navigating by lists (<kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>) or by standard VO navigation. When navigated to, VO will announce "list x items" or "end of list" depending on the entry point.</p>
